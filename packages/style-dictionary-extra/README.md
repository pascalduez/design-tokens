# style-dictionary-extra

[Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) extensions to ease design tokens definitions following the [Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG)](https://tr.designtokens.org) specifications. 

> Notes: just storing some work here, for easier referencing and sharing.
> Currently no plan to publish or make it a full fledged project.
> There's [style-dictionary-utils](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/style-dictionary-utils) which acheive similar results. I would never have written all this if I had discovered it earlier.

> Notes: Most of this will probably be useless with Style Dictionary v4.
